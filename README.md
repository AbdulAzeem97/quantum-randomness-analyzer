# Quantum 3-Coin Flip Simulator (PennyLane)

This project simulates the flipping of **3 quantum coins** using the **PennyLane** quantum computing library. It uses Hadamard gates to create quantum superpositions and measurements to simulate probabilistic outcomes â€” demonstrating **quantum randomness**.

## ğŸ’¡ Motivation

Classical coins yield deterministic outcomes based on physical conditions. In contrast, quantum coin flips harness **superposition and measurement** â€” truly random, rooted in quantum mechanics.

This simulation helps in visualizing and analyzing the statistical nature of quantum randomness using 3 independent qubits.

## ğŸ§ª How It Works

1. **Initialize 3 Qubits**: All start in the |0âŸ© (Tails) state.
2. **Apply Hadamard Gates**: Each qubit becomes a superposition:  
   \|ÏˆâŸ© = (|0âŸ© + |1âŸ©)/âˆš2
3. **Measure**: Collapse state to either |0âŸ© or |1âŸ©.
4. **Interpretation**:
   - |0âŸ© = Tails (T)
   - |1âŸ© = Heads (H)
